# Machine Vision

Machine Vision (or Computer Vision) is the field of study that aims at extracting relevant information from images. It attempts to replicate human visual perception, i.e. the ability to an interpret the environment using visible light.

Central to machine vision are images, which are mappings from a 2D image space to a 3D colour space, i.e. RGB.

Videos are nothing but a sequence of videos.

## The Repository
The repository for Machine Vision is like a folder or storage space that contains all the files such as code, documentation, images, and more related to real-world machine vision problems using Python 3 and OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision). 

It also tracks every change that I or my team makes to each file.

It is always possible go back to previous versions in case we make any mistakes.

So, feel free, be more human, to make mistakes and to learn from them.
